Layout/Concept

Relies on system commands "barcode", "cat", "find", "md5sum", "pstopnm", "pnmtopng"

If your distribution does not provide "barcode", you can download source from:

ftp://mirrors.kernel.org/gnu/barcode/

If your distribution does not provide netpbm for "pstopnm" and "pnmtopng", you
can download source from:

http://netpbm.sourceforge.net/

gui all lives under "fossbarcode", uses django so you need python-django or
  equivalent

By default, typing "make" in the top-level will create the SQLite
  database the app needs, and the documentation.
 
barcode: bulk of the gui code
  models.py is the database/form models
  views.py is the data/form processing code

media: css, images, docs, js, user_data

templates: html pages using django's "template" language for data/form
	   handling (these also have some javascript glue)

The web app can be run "in-place"; otherwise, it expects to be run
from /opt/linuxfoundation/fossbarcode.

To run the gui/server (as user compliance for installed package):
   /opt/linuxfoundation/bin/foss-barcode.py start (for running installed)
   
To run the application in place, you *must* first run "make" to create the
database and docs:
   make
   bin/foss-barcode.py start (for running in-place)

"foss-barcode.py stop" will stop the server.

to access the gui: http://127.0.0.1:8000/barcode
admin interface: http://127/0.0.1:8000/admin 
	(username compliance, password compliance)
